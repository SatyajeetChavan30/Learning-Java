Java OOP Practice

Overview
This repository is dedicated to practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. The purpose is to help developers strengthen their understanding of OOP principles through hands-on coding exercises and examples. It covers essential topics such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation, enabling a deeper understanding of Java's object-oriented features.

Structure and Usage
The repository is organized into folders that separate examples, exercises, and concepts for clarity. You can clone the repository and open it in your favorite Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. Explore the src folder to find files that demonstrate key OOP concepts. Compile and run these files to see their implementation in action. If you are new to Java, make sure you have JDK 11 or a later version installed on your system.

Learning Objectives
By working through the examples and exercises, you will gain practical knowledge of how to design and implement real-world solutions using OOP principles. Topics like encapsulating data with getter and setter methods, creating hierarchies with inheritance, and designing flexible systems using polymorphism and abstraction will be covered. Additionally, constructors and exception handling will be introduced to help you write more robust and reliable Java applications.

Example Exercises
Exercises are designed to reinforce concepts. For instance, you can create a Car class with attributes like make, model, and year, and display the information of multiple cars. Another exercise could involve designing an abstract class for animals and creating subclasses like Dog and Cat that implement specific behaviors.

Resources and Tools
To maximize your learning, it is recommended to use JDK 11 or higher along with an IDE that supports Java development. Comprehensive resources like the Oracle Java Tutorials, GeeksforGeeks, and Codecademy are excellent for supplementing your learning journey.

Contribution and License
Contributions to this repository are welcome. You can enhance the examples, suggest new exercises, or report any issues you encounter. The project is licensed under the MIT License, so feel free to use and modify the code as needed.
